Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to Github account
Keys pressed: ```<^r>``` ```<enter>``` , ```<^r>``` ```<enter>```,```<^r>``` ```<enter>``` ```cmd v``` ```<enter>```

To avoid typing the same commands as before, I used ```<^r>``` again and typed ```git``` and the ```add```, ```commit``` and ```push``` eventually autofilled. After adding and committing, I utilized  ```cmd v``` to print the ssh clone link from Github.com and pressed ```<enter>``` in order to push the changes.
